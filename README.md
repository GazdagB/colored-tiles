# 🎨 Colored Tiles – A Fast-Paced Color Reaction Game

Colored Tiles is a minimalist browser game where quick reflexes and visual focus are the key.It's kindof a rage game. Testes your patience too. Hover over tiles to reveal colors — and click only when it's your color. Simple? Yes. Easy? Not quite.

[👉 Play it live here](https://160tiles.netlify.app/)

## 🧠 How to Play
* The game board contains 160 tiles.

* Hovering over a tile changes its color randomly.

* You're assigned a target color at the start.

* Only click tiles when they match your target color.

* The game tracks your click count and starts a timer as soon as you begin.

* Your goal: Finish all 160 tiles with the fewest clicks and fastest time.
